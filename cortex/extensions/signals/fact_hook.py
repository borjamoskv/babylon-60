"""CORTEX Signal Hook — fact:stored reactive emission.

Every call to ``engine.store()`` emits a ``fact:stored`` signal into
the persistent Signal Bus (L1 consciousness layer).  The emission is:

- **Invisible** to the operator: never raises, never blocks the store.
- **Non-blocking**: uses a fire-and-forget pattern via a direct sync
  write to the *separate* signals table (different connection object).
- **Self-healing**: if the bus table hasn't been created yet, it is
  bootstrapped on the first emission.
- **Reactive seeds**: the payload carries enough context for downstream
  consumers (``compact``, ``export``) to act autonomously:

  ``fact:stored`` payload schema::

      {
        "fact_id":    int,         # ID of the newly persisted fact
        "project":    str,         # Project scope
        "fact_type":  str,         # decision | error | ghost | knowledge …
        "source":     str,         # Originating agent / tool
        "tenant_id":  str,         # Isolation scope (default → "default")
        "total_facts": int | None, # Live count (None if query fails)
      }

Compact auto-trigger threshold
-------------------------------
When the count of *unconsumed* ``fact:stored`` signals for a given
project exceeds ``COMPACT_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD``, a single ``compact:needed``
signal is also emitted so that a listening daemon (``cortex compact``) or
a future L2 reactor can auto-execute compaction without human intervention.
This is the *neural seed* of L2 reactivity: the first emit() is invisible,
the second is a consequence — the system develops reflexes.
