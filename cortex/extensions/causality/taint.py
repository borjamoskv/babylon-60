"""Taint Propagation Engine — Axiom Ω₁₃ Enforcement.

When a fact_node is invalidated or loses confidence, propagate impact
to descendants and recalculate effective_confidence. Without this,
derived facts float on cadáveres perfumados — structurally elegant,
epistemically corrupt.

Algorithm: BFS from invalidated node.
- Invalidated node → TAINTED, effective_confidence = C1
- Direct children → minimum SUSPECT
- Children with ≥50% TAINTED parents → TAINTED
- Recalculate effective_confidence at every touched node

Enforcement: derived persistence is blocked if taint_status != CLEAN.
