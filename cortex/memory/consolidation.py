"""CORTEX v6+ — Silent Engrams & Systems Consolidation.

Strategy 4: Implements Tonegawa's discovery of silent engrams.

When a fact is stored, TWO engrams are created simultaneously:
  - Active engram in L2-hot (hippocampus): immediately searchable.
  - Silent engram in L3 (cortex): invisible to search until matured.

The silent engram matures autonomously over N days without contradiction.
If the active engram decays but the silent one has matured → memory persists.
If both decay → natural death (thermodynamic pruning).

Compute-in-Memory principle: Each engram carries its OWN maturation logic
as embedded methods, not as external daemon processing. The memory IS
the processor — no separation between storage and computation.
