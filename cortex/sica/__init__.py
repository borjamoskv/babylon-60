"""SICA — Self-Improving Cognitive Architecture.

Nelson-Narens (1990) dual-level metacognitive agent framework.

The META-LEVEL monitors and controls the OBJECT-LEVEL:
  - MONITOR (bottom-up): observes execution traces, error patterns, strategy fitness
  - CONTROL (top-down): mutates search strategies, adjusts tool selection, rewrites heuristics

Distinguishes between:
  - "I failed at the task" → object-level correction
  - "I failed at HOW I THINK about the task" → meta-level strategy mutation

Constitutional evaluation layer inspired by Anthropic Constitutional AI:
  each output is judged against immutable epistemic principles before emission.
