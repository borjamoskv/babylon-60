"""
CORTEX v6.0 — StorageAdapter Protocol.

Unified interface that abstracts all read/write operations from the engine.
All storage backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Turso) must implement this protocol
so CortexEngine never knows which backend is active.

Design invariants:
- Protocol is runtime_checkable — adapters are verified at init time.
- commit() is part of the contract; no-op for auto-commit backends (asyncpg).
- health_check() must always return bool, never raise.
