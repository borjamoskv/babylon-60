    This class does not reach into the engine internals directly.
    Instead, it operates over ExecutionTrace objects and opaque
    `state` / `causal_graph` / `vote_ledger` / `replay_engine`
    placeholders, so that callers can progressively wire real
    integrations without breaking the core contract.

    The initial implementation keeps all components trace-local:

    - D_ledger, D_causal, D_consensus, D_proj are 0.0 by default
      (placeholders to be wired to real signals later).
    - H_branch is a simple monotonic function of trace length, acting
      as a proxy for branching/complexity. This makes the operator
      usable in tests and basic profiling without requiring full
      engine wiring.
