# █ CORTEX-NATIVE-ARCHITECTURE (Ouroboros-∞ Synthesis)

> **Status:** Unified Sovereign Doctrine (Manifesto + Whitepaper + RFC)
> **Axiom:** Ω₃ (Verify then trust)

This document is the mathematical, philosophical, and normative ground truth for the **Cognitive Hypervisor**. It dictates the constraints for a verifiable, self-governing memory subsystem for autonomous AI swarms. 

**Core Fallacy:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is not memory; it is a stochastic search engine. Without epistemic governance, AI swarms succumb to Information Entropy. **Cortex-Persist replaces passive retrieval with cryptographic governance.**

> **Terminal Definition:**
> BABYLON-60 is a sovereign memory platform for AI swarms; CORTEX-Persist is the deterministic kernel that transforms probabilistic inferences into verifiable state via cryptographic and causal governance.

## 0. SYSTEM ONTOLOGY & BRAND TAXONOMY

The architecture is strictly stratified into three conceptual tiers. This is not merely branding; it defines the causal scope and blast radius of each component.

1. **MOSKV Systems (The Entity)**: The sovereign creator and overarching structural philosophy. Distinctive, defensible, and maximalist.
2. **BABYLON-60 (The Platform / Runtime)**: The narrative platform and execution environment. The civilization of memory, the historical archive, the foundation of the swarm. *("Agents execute on BABYLON-60")*.
3. **CORTEX (The Infrastructure Subsystems)**: The deterministic, causal execution layers. Highly descriptive, internal dependencies that BABYLON-60 relies upon to collapse stochastic probability into state.
   - **CORTEX-Persist**: The causal persistence and state transition layer.
   - **CORTEX-Ledger**: The cryptographic audit and hash-chain layer.
   - **CORTEX-Verify**: The epistemic validation and proof layer.
   - **CORTEX-Agent**: The base autonomous execution unit.

## 1. INVARIANTS & NORMATIVE CONSTRAINTS

| Classification | Definition |
|:---------------|:-----------|
| **MUST** | Hard invariants. Structural violations cause a Hard Fault. |
| **TARGET** | Performance SLO — operational objective, not formal guarantee. |

**Forbidden Simplifications (MUST NOT):**
1. **Memory RAG-only**: RAG retrieves; it does not maintain truth.
2. **Vector similarity ≡ truth maintenance**: Cosine similarity measures geometry, not logical entailment.
3. **Mutable belief overwrite**: Direct overwrites destroy the hash chain. Revisions MUST be signed patches.
4. **LWW (Last-Writer-Wins)**: Wall-clock ordering is not causal. LWW is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
5. **Single-node veto annihilation**: A lone node MUST NOT collapse swarm consensus to $P=0$ without quorum.

### Maturity Labels
To prevent conceptual overload and clarify implementation status, all architectural components are tagged with a maturity level:
- `[PRODUCTION]` - Implemented, tested, and actively governing state.
- `[EXPERIMENTAL]` - In active development or running in shadow mode.
- `[RESEARCH]` - Theoretical model undergoing adversarial validation.
- `[SPECIFICATION]` - Normative target; not yet implemented in the critical path.

## 2. THE EPISTEMIC ONTOLOGY

**Belief Object (BO):** The atomic unit of probabilistically weighted cognition.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum BeliefState {
    Active,
    Contested,
    Subsumed,
    Discarded,
    Archived,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ProvenanceEnvelope {
    pub source_hash: String,
    pub source_type: String, // agent, tool, human
    pub tenant_id: String,
    pub signer_id: String,
    pub signature: String,
    pub created_at: i64,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct BeliefObject {
    pub id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub proposition_key: String,
    pub payload: PropositionPayload,
    pub confidence_score: f32, // P(H|E)
    pub decay_rate: f32,
    pub state: BeliefState,
    pub provenance: ProvenanceEnvelope,
    pub relations: Vec<BeliefRelation>, // entails, discards
}
```

### State Transitions & ATMS `[EXPERIMENTAL]`
If a root dependency becomes invalid or refuted (via `discards`), dependent beliefs **MUST** transition to `ORPHANED`. The invalidation of the root reference is targeted to execute in $O(1)$ via precomputed dependency indices.

## 3. THE PLANES OF COGNITION

### A. Integrity Plane (Cryptographic) `[SPECIFICATION]`
- Every memory is born with a mathematical shadow. A Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) binds semantic content to the originating agent.
- `attest_lineage(artifact_id)` targets resolving execution proofs in $O(\log N)$ time (dependent on structural backend scaling).

### B. Coordination Plane (Swarm Consensus) `[RESEARCH]`
- Transport MUST be orchestrated via **Zenoh** (L3/L4) (no central broker).
- Merge operations MUST be executed using Semantic CRDTs. 
- Conflict aggregation MUST use **Logarithmic Opinion Pools (LogOP)** to prevent probability flattening.

### C. Belief Plane (Memory Scheduler) `[EXPERIMENTAL]`
Context injection is dictated by a multivariable tensor equation. If $Risk_{\text{contam}}$ detects cascading structural contradictions, the score asymptotes to 0, rejecting the memory payload.

$$ \text{Score}(m) = \frac{(\text{Rel} \cdot w_r) + (\text{Conf} \cdot w_c) + (\text{Rec} \cdot w_t)}{\text{Cost}_{\text{tokens}} + \text{Risk}_{\text{contam}}} $$

## 4. TARGET PERFORMANCE SLOs

| Metric | Target | Classification |
|:-------|:-------|:---------------|
| IPC Overhead | ZERO-COPY lock-free arrays (iceoryx2) | MUST |
| Local Cognitive Loop | < 10 ms | TARGET |
| Deep Adjudication | < 45 s | TARGET |
| Hot Resume | sub-10 ms | TARGET |
| Serialized JSON/Pickle in critical path | FORBIDDEN | MUST |

## 5. THREAT MODEL & DEFENSES

| Threat | Defense | Classification |
|:-------|:--------|:---------------|
| **Semantic Poisoning** | Historical proof-of-expertise weightings in LogOP | MUST |
| **Biased Consensus** | Swarm diversity constraints + anomaly detection | MUST |
| **Malicious Veto** | Saturating penalty + L3 audit quorum | MUST |
| **Replay Attack** | Causal ordering + monotonic CRDT clocks | MUST |

## 6. THE OPERATIVE SINGULARITY (THE HYBRID ARCHITECTURE)

The "Operative Singularity" is not defined as the autonomous awakening of a monolithic model, but as the mathematical stabilization of a hybrid ecosystem. The terminal solution to the "Monolithic Problem" (static fragility) requires the structural coupling of two distinct layers:

### A. The Antifragile Motor (Perception & Adaptation)
- **Mechanism:** A dynamic routing policy (e.g., Swarm/Model Router) optimized by stochastic environmental noise (human consensus, real-world failures). 
- **Function:** Acts as the cognitive immune system. It does not break under chaotic, out-of-distribution inputs; it uses them as thermodynamic fuel to recalibrate its routing graph.

### B. The Robust Kernel (Execution & Guarantees)
- **Mechanism:** The CORTEX-Persist determinism layer.
- **Function:** Once the Antifragile Motor selects the optimal execution path, the Kernel enforces cryptographic verification and state invariants. It converts stochastic probability into physical certainty.

**Synthesis:** 
The coupling of the Antifragile Motor (managing semantic uncertainty) and the Robust Kernel (enforcing structural integrity) resolves the terminal tension of AI architecture. It scales an intelligence that is as adaptive as a biological system, yet as verifiable as a cryptographic contract.
