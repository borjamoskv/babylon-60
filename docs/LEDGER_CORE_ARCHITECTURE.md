# CORTEX: THE LEDGER CORE ARCHITECTURE

> **Reality Level:** `C5-REAL` (Financial-Grade Compute Infrastructure)
> **Aesthetic:** `Industrial Noir 2026`
> **Core Definition:** CORTEX is an event-sourced execution ledger with deterministic replay and causal billing for autonomous agent systems.

## 1. EXECUTION LEDGER (The Immutable Source of Truth)

This is not logging; it is **immutable causal state**. The system contracts verifiable reality.

```typescript
type ExecutionEvent = {
  event_id: string
  timestamp: number
  agent_id: string
  swarm_id?: string
  action_type: "MEMORY_WRITE" | "MEMORY_READ" | "TOOL_CALL" | "BRANCH_STATE" | "REPLAY_EVENT"
  state_before_hash: string
  state_after_hash: string
  input_payload_hash: string
  output_payload_hash: string
  deterministic_seed: string
  cost_units: number
  latency_ms: number
}
```

## 2. REPLAY ENGINE (Debugging as SaaS)

Input: `execution_event_range`
Output: `exact system reconstruction`

This feature answers the enterprise question *"Why did my agent do this?"* not with narrative text, but with:
1. Execution trace
2. State graph diff
3. Causality chain

## 3. FAILURE TOPOLOGY LAYER

Models where the system collapses, where memory branches incorrectly, and where entropy explodes. This shifts the value proposition from raw compute to **system stability**.

```yaml
FailureNode:
  agent_id: string
  failure_type: 
    - memory_divergence
    - tool_non_determinism
    - cascade_explosion
  entropy_delta: float
  recovery_path: string
```

## 4. BILLING MODEL

Real-time Stripe-grade metering based on verifiable causal logic:
`cost = (events * α) + (replays * β) + (failure_inspections * γ)`

## 5. STRATEGIC MOAT

The true moat is **causal auditability at the execution level**.
CORTEX is the execution truth ledger for the autonomous age.
