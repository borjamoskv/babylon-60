## 1. Hero

### The Epistemic Foundation of BABYLON-60-Persist

A sovereign memory substrate for autonomous systems. Built on cryptographic invariants, thermodynamic efficiency, and absolute verification boundaries.

This is not a SaaS tool. It is infrastructure designed for the Direct-Silicon transition.

## 2. Introduction (The Paradigm Shift)

LLMs are generative compressors, not truth engines. 
Hallucination is not a bug; it is a structural cost of probabilistic generation.

Expecting an unanchored model to maintain perfect operational memory over thousands of steps is mathematically flawed. Intelligence requires friction with a deterministic environment.

BABYLON-60-Persist provides that friction. It shifts the ultimate truth of the system from a transient, stochastic context window (C4-SIM) to an immutable, verifiable ledger on disk (C5-REAL).

## 3. The Sovereign Laws (Doctrine Overview)

BABYLON-60-Persist is governed by four absolute thermodynamic and operational pillars designed to expel entropy and preserve state integrity.

### I. Information Thermodynamics (Zero Ontology)
*   **Exergy Conservation:** Any computation that does not reduce uncertainty is anergy (heat and noise).
*   **Applied Landauer Limit:** Erasing useless memory requires energy; retaining it indefinitely corrupts context. Apoptosis of irrelevant data is mandatory.
*   **Zero Slop Tolerance:** Apologies, Green Theater, and decorative prose in AI outputs are radioactive token leaks.
*   **Causal Isomorphism:** Code and state must be an exact 1:1 map of the problem's mental graph.
*   **Shannon Density:** Strict maximization of meaning per token. A dense, structured YAML or JSON will always outperform free text.

### II. Fault Tolerance and Concurrency (0-Lock Engine)
*   **Deadlock by Default:** Any blocking synchronous I/O in an async loop is treated as a critical event loop failure.
*   **SQLite WAL Invariant:** Rigid configuration `journal_mode=WAL` and `busy_timeout=5000`. No reader ever blocks a writer.
*   **Poison Quarantine (Dead-Letter):** Corrupt or failed transactions are not silently discarded; they are isolated in quarantine for forensic analysis.
*   **Absolute Idempotence:** Executing an operation 1 time or 1,000 times produces exactly the same cryptographic signature and hash in the final state.
*   **Saga Invariant:** Every state advancement (N) has its corresponding compensatory rollback (N-1) guaranteed and instrumented.

### III. Epistemic Isolation and Cryptographic Sovereignty (Byzantine Boundary)
*   **Hallucination Containment:** All generative output (C4-SIM) is treated as hostile stochastic conjecture until it crosses the validation gates.
*   **Cryptographic Signature (Taint Engine):** No fact mutates state without a `cortex-taint` token signed with `SHA3-256` tracing its lineage (Agent, Session, Origin Hash).
*   **Byzantine Tolerance (f < n/3):** Distributed Swarm consensus requiring N=3 independent peer validations before authorizing writes to the Master Ledger.
*   **Secret Apoptosis:** Ephemeral keys and session credentials are cryptographically destroyed in RAM immediately upon transaction completion.
*   **Minimum Orthogonal Privilege:** Total role segregation. Auditor agents operate in absolute read-only; executors cannot self-approve their guards.

### IV. Autopoiesis and Ledger Gravity (Legion-Centuria)
*   **Autonomous Mitosis:** Parallel delegation of high-entropy tasks to isolated workers (`invoke_subagent`) under asynchronous Hypervisor orchestration.
*   **Git-Sentinel as Ledger (AX-041):** The Git DAG is treated as the system's immutable causal database. Each commit hash is the cryptographic proof of a collapse in C5-REAL.
*   **Nexus Anchoring (Ω6 - Zero Duplicates):** Prohibition of physical duplication of code patterns. Shared dependencies are unified in a master node and projected via physical symlinks.
*   **Episodic Continuity:** The automaton does not improvise; it actively reads the disk vault (`~/.gemini/config/.cortex/memory_vault/`) to anchor its historical context.
*   **Limerence Bypass:** Absolute restriction of infinite cycles: 1 prompt produces exactly 1 physical state action/mutation followed by apoptosis (Halt).

## 4. Core Architectural Axioms

### Axiom I: No Hidden Entropy
If a decision, state change, or memory mutation is not tracked in the cryptographic ledger, it does not causally exist. Memory without evidence is discarded.

### Axiom II: Deterministic Time-Travel
Autonomy requires absolute failure locality. Invalid state must be rejectable and abortable at any point. Rollbacks in BABYLON-60 map directly to exact checkpoints in time, ensuring clean recovery from agent drift.

### Axiom III: Knowledge Is Crystallized
Fluid intelligence is not retrieving a pre-trained static concept; it is synthesizing an ad-hoc abstraction at runtime. BABYLON-60 allows swarms to deduce rules dynamically and persist them as invariant facts.

---

## 5. The Holy Grail: JIT Concept Formation

Modern agents waste valuable exergy trying to guess solutions through massive, repetitive stochastic inference.

BABYLON-60-Persist enables **JIT (Just-In-Time) Concept Formation**. Instead of relying on static, pre-trained weights to solve a novel problem, the system allows agents to observe anomalies, deduce the underlying structural rule, and elevate that rule into a permanent, typed memory.

Form the concept programmatically once. Crystallize it in the ledger. Execute forever.

---

## 6. Technical Constraints
*   All persisted facts must pass guard validation before write.
*   Ledger continuity must remain cryptographically verifiable at all times.
*   Schema changes must preserve migration safety and rollback awareness.
*   Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest (AES-GCM).

## 7. Final CTA

### Build on truth, not probability.

The next generation of AI systems won't be defined by how well they generate text, but by how reliably they maintain state.
