# REST API Reference

CORTEX exposes a FastAPI application via `cortex.api:app`. The public HTTP surface is versioned
primarily under `/v1`, and interactive docs are available at `/docs` when the app is not running
in production mode.

---

## Run Locally

```bash
pip install "cortex-persist[api]"
uvicorn cortex.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8484
```

Interactive docs: `http://localhost:8484/docs`

To export a static OpenAPI document:

```bash
python -c "from cortex.api.openapi import export_openapi_spec; print(export_openapi_spec())"
```

By default this writes `docs/openapi.json`.

---

## Authentication

API keys are created through the admin surface and then passed as Bearer tokens.

```bash
# Bootstrap the first key
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8484/v1/admin/keys?name=my-client&tenant_id=default"

# Use the returned token on subsequent requests
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ctx_xxxxxxxxxx" \
  http://localhost:8484/v1/status
```

## Compatibility Notes

Legacy clients using `/v1/memories/*` are redirected to `/v1/facts/*` for backward
compatibility. New integrations should target the `/v1/facts` surface directly.
