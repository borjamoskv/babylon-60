# BABYLON-60 Core Specification Blueprint v1.0

## Status

**Document Status:** Conceptual Architecture (Frozen)

This document defines the architectural invariants and abstract execution model of BABYLON-60. It is intentionally independent of any implementation language, machine learning model, storage engine or execution runtime.

It is **not** an implementation specification. Its purpose is to define the properties that every conforming implementation shall preserve.

---

# Design Goal

BABYLON-60 is an architecture for governing computational knowledge under explicit uncertainty.

Its objective is not to maximize the probability of producing correct answers, but to maximize the traceability, reproducibility and auditability of every inference performed by the system.

The architecture therefore specifies invariants over the reasoning process rather than guarantees about empirical correctness.

---

# Core Epistemic Invariants

Every conforming implementation shall preserve the following invariants.

### MI-001 Structural Decoupling

Natural language is an interface.

Inference operates exclusively over typed epistemic structures.

No language model is authorized to establish epistemic truth.

---

### MI-002 Non-Circular Evidence

No syntactic artifact generated within the system constitutes independent evidence for its own claims.

Evidence dependencies shall remain acyclic.

---

### MI-003 Vectorial Trust

Trust is represented as a multidimensional state

T(H) = (P, I, A, R, F, C, S)

rather than as a scalar confidence score.

---

### MI-004 Monotonic Independence

Evidence that is causally dependent upon previously incorporated evidence shall not increase the independent evidential weight of any hypothesis.

---

### MI-005 Computational Metareasoning

Verification priority is determined by an explicit optimization policy balancing expected epistemic value against computational verification cost.

---

### MI-006 Epistemic Conservation

Internal transformations of representation do not increase verifiable information.

Only external evidence or formally valid inference may increase the epistemic content of the system.

---

# Architectural Layers

The architecture separates three orthogonal concerns.

1. Semantic Interpretation
2. Epistemic Validation
3. Presentation

Each layer communicates exclusively through typed intermediate representations.

---

# Research Boundary

The following components remain active research problems and are intentionally left unspecified in this document.

* Trust Algebra
* Independence Metrics
* Formal Semantics of CPG
* Verification Cost Functions
* Trust Calibration
* Constraint Optimization Strategy

Future specifications shall define these components independently while preserving the invariants defined above.

---

# Conformance Principle

An implementation conforms to BABYLON-60 if—and only if—it preserves the architectural invariants defined in this document.

Performance, implementation language, hardware architecture and underlying language models are intentionally outside the scope of conformance.

---

# Engineering Governance Lifecycle

The evolution of BABYLON-60 is strictly decoupled from implementation volatility via the following separation of concerns:

* **Blueprint (Current):** Defines principles, invariants, and abstract architecture.
* **CEP (BABYLON-60 Enhancement Proposals):** Refine and formalize concrete components (Trust Algebra, EDL, CPG, etc.).
* **Core Specification:** Consolidates approved CEPs into a single normative standard.
* **Reference Kernel:** Canonical implementation demonstrating the specification is executable.
* **Conformance Test Suite:** Independent verification suite any implementation must pass to declare conformance.
