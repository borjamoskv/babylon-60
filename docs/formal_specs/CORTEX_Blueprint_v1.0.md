# BABYLON-60 Core Specification Blueprint v1.0

## Status

**Document Status:** Conceptual Architecture (Frozen)

This document defines the architectural invariants and abstract execution model of BABYLON-60. It is intentionally independent of any implementation language, machine learning model, storage engine or execution runtime.

It is **not** an implementation specification. Its purpose is to define the properties that every conforming implementation shall preserve.

---

# Design Goal

BABYLON-60 v1.0 is not a theory of truth, nor is it a complete theory of trust. 

It is an architectural proposal designed to make the epistemological decisions of a computational system explicit, typed, traceable, and auditable. 

Its primary contribution is not to solve the problem of trust, but to prevent that problem from remaining implicit. The architecture therefore specifies invariants over the reasoning process, shifting the burden from implicit narrative generation to explicit epistemic governance.

# Core Epistemic Invariants

Every conforming implementation shall preserve the following invariants.

### MI-001 Structural Decoupling

Natural language is an interface.

Inference operates exclusively over typed epistemic structures.

No language model is authorized to establish epistemic truth.

---

### MI-002 Non-Circular Evidence

No syntactic artifact generated within the system constitutes independent evidence for its own claims.

Evidence dependencies shall remain acyclic.

---

### MI-003 Vectorial Trust

Trust is represented as a multidimensional state

T(H) = (P, I, A, R, F, C, S)

rather than as a scalar confidence score.

---

### MI-004 Monotonic Independence

Evidence that is causally dependent upon previously incorporated evidence shall not increase the independent evidential weight of any hypothesis.

---

### MI-005 Computational Metareasoning

Verification priority is determined by an explicit optimization policy balancing expected epistemic value against computational verification cost.

---

### MI-006 Epistemic Conservation

Internal transformations of representation do not increase verifiable information.

Only external evidence or formally valid inference may increase the epistemic content of the system.

---

# Architectural Layers

The architecture separates three orthogonal concerns.

1. Semantic Interpretation
2. Epistemic Validation
3. Presentation

Each layer communicates exclusively through typed intermediate representations.

---

# Research Boundary

The following components remain active research problems and are intentionally left unspecified in this document.

* Parameterizable Trust Algebra (Domain-specific frameworks)
* Independence Metrics
* Formal Semantics of CPG
* Verification Cost Functions
* Second-Order Calibration (Validation of the epistemological model)
* Constraint Optimization Strategy

Future specifications shall define these components independently while preserving the invariants defined above.

---

# Conformance Principle

An implementation conforms to BABYLON-60 if—and only if—it preserves the architectural invariants defined in this document.

Performance, implementation language, hardware architecture and underlying language models are intentionally outside the scope of conformance.

---

# Taxonomy of Project State

The project lifecycle acknowledges three distinct levels of maturity:

* **Blueprint (v1.0):** Defines principles, invariants, and abstract architecture. (Status: FROZEN).
* **CEP (BABYLON-60 Engineering Proposals):** Refines and formalizes specific components like the parameterizable Trust Algebra. (Status: OPEN SPECIFICATION).
* **Reference Kernel & Test Suite:** Canonical implementation and conformance testing. (Status: NON-EXISTENT).

# Methodological Note: The Epistemic OS

The primary contribution of BABYLON-60 is not judged by the sophistication of its algorithms, but by the quality and stability of its epistemic interfaces.

A conforming epistemic interface possesses four fundamental properties:
1. **Explicit:** Every claim must be accompanied by the epistemic state from which it was emitted.
2. **Composable:** New inference mechanisms, trust models, or evidence sources must integrate without violating architectural invariants.
3. **Audited:** Every state transition must be strictly reconstructable from verifiable artifacts.
4. **Replaceable:** No concrete trust model, provenance system, or inference engine constitutes an essential part of the architecture.

BABYLON-60 is designed to function as an **Operating System for Epistemological Models**. Just as an OS defines stable abstractions (processes, memory, file systems) allowing diverse applications to coexist, BABYLON-60 defines stable infrastructure allowing multiple trust theories, inference engines, and provenance models to be implemented, compared, and replaced without altering fundamental system contracts.
