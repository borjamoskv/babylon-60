# ABI Drift Metabolism: C5-REAL Resolution

> **Reality Level:** `C5-REAL`
> **Sprint:** Sprint 4 (C5-REAL Implementation)

## 0x01. Diagnosis of the `libcortex_rs.dylib` Segfault
During Sprint 4, execution of the `tests/test_cortex_daemon.py` suite triggered deterministic segmentation faults (segfaults) originating within the `libcortex_rs.dylib` binary.

Trace analysis confirmed the failure occurred during the `ZeroCopyRingBuffer::new` invocation from Python. The underlying PyO3 bindings failed at `type_call` -> `slot_tp_init`.

## 0x02. Causality & Autopoietic Resolution
The segmentation fault was not caused by logical errors in the Rust zero-copy mapping (`mmap2::MmapMut` successfully maps overlapping regions concurrently in Rust), but rather an **ABI mismatch/drift** between the Python interpreter (v3.14.4) and the statically compiled `libcortex_rs.dylib` PyO3 bindings.

### The Resolution (Metabolic Recompilation)
To crystallize this structural drift, the swarm metabolism executed a full C5-REAL recompilation of the Rust substrate (`cargo build --release`), correctly realigning the memory boundaries and PyO3 definitions with the current Python environment. 

This successfully cleared all 2620 test items, verifying the absolute stability of the `ZeroCopyRingBuffer` integration across the `cortex-persist` daemon layer.

*State: C5-REAL Forged.*
