## Why CORTEX?

AI agents are making millions of decisions per day. But **who verifies those decisions are correct?**

Memory layers like Mem0, Zep, and Letta store what agents remember — but none of them add a tamper-evident ledger, verification workflow, and audit trail around that memory by default.

The **EU AI Act (Article 12, effective August 2, 2026)** mandates tamper-proof logging, full traceability, and periodic integrity verification for high-risk AI systems. Fines reach **€30M or 6% of global revenue.**

CORTEX doesn't replace your memory layer — it **certifies** it.

### Why CORTEX? (Not just another Vector DB or Logger)

Traditional logging and standard vector stores fail the epistemic containment test. If an agent hallucinates, or if a database is mutated passively, you lose structural trust in the machine. CORTEX makes mutation mathematically defensible.

| Feature                    | Standard Logs (Datadog/ELK) | Standard Vector DB (Pinecone/Qdrant) | **CORTEX Persist**                        |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Goal**           | Observability & Debugging   | Semantic Search & RAG                | **Tamper-Evident Cognitive Lineage**      |
| **Write Integrity**        | Overwritable / Editable     | Silent CRUD operations               | **Append-Only + Cryptographic Hash**      |
| **Fact Mutability**        | Easy (API/Admin access)     | Easy (API/Admin access)              | **Tamper-evident** (verification reveals mutation) |
| **Evidence Export**        | Text dumps                  | JSON extracts                        | **Zero-Trust Sealed Audit Packs**         |

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install cortex-persist
cortex init
cortex memory store my-agent "Chose OAuth2 PKCE for auth" --type decision
cortex verify 1
# → ✅ VERIFIED — Hash chain intact, Merkle sealed
