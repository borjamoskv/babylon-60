# AGENTS.md — CORTEX Persist

Trust infrastructure for autonomous AI:
cryptographic verification, audit trails, epistemic containment, and agent memory.

Package: cortex-persist v0.3.0b1
Engine: v8
License: Apache-2.0
Python: >=3.10

## Scope

CORTEX Persist is a local-first trust substrate for autonomous, tool-using, and
multi-agent AI systems. It persists facts, enforces deterministic validation
boundaries, maintains cryptographic auditability, and treats generative output
as conjecture until externally verified.

This file is the operational contract for contributors, maintainers, and coding
agents working inside the repository.

## Core Invariants

- All persisted facts must pass guard validation before write.
- Ledger continuity must remain cryptographically verifiable.
- Async code must never block the event loop.
- Public read/write paths must remain tenant-aware.
- Sensitive data must not be stored unencrypted.
- Stochastic outputs must not mutate persistent state without deterministic validation.
- Schema changes must preserve migration safety, auditability, and rollback awareness.
- CLI modules are thin wrappers; business logic belongs in engine, services, or managers.
- New features must preserve failure locality: invalid state must be rejectable and abortable.

## Critical Paths

| Path | Risk | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `engine/` | Critical | Core CRUD, orchestration, and mixin composition |
| `memory/` | Critical | Large public API surface |
| `ledger.py` | Critical | Hash-chain integrity and trust continuity |
| `migrations/` | Critical | Irreversible production impact |
| `guards/` | High | Admission, contradiction, dependency, and injection-detection surfaces |
| `verification/` | High | Formal or deterministic validation surfaces |
| `routes/` | High | External API contract |
| `cli/` | Medium | Thin wrappers only |
| `daemon/` | Medium | Background process state and scheduling |
| `llm/` | Medium | Provider routing, caching, hedging, validation |

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| **Language** | Python 3.10–3.13 |
| **Database** | SQLite + `sqlite-vec` (vector search), `aiosqlite` (async) |
| **Embeddings** | `sentence-transformers` + ONNX Runtime |
| **Crypto** | `cryptography` + `keyring` (OS-native vault) |
| **API** | FastAPI + Uvicorn (optional: `[api]`) |
| **CLI** | Click + Rich |
| **Cloud** | `asyncpg` (AlloyDB), `redis` (L1 cache), `qdrant-client` (vector cloud) — optional: `[cloud]` |
| **Linting** | Ruff (`E`, `F`, `W`, `I`, `UP`, `B`, `ASYNC` — line length 100). Enforces non-blocking limits structurally |
| **Type check** | Pyright (basic mode) |
| **Testing** | pytest + pytest-asyncio + pytest-cov |

## Build / Test / Quality

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
pytest tests/ -v --cov=cortex
ruff check cortex/
pyright cortex/
uvicorn cortex.api:app --reload
```

## Environment

Common environment variables:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY
CORTEX_DB_PATH
CORTEX_LOG_LEVEL
CORTEX_ENCRYPTION_KEY
HF_TOKEN
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
REDIS_URL
DATABASE_URL
```

## Coding Rules

- Type hints on all public functions.
- Catch specific exceptions only.
- Prefer O(1) structures over repeated O(N) scans.
- Use standard library first; minimize dependencies.
- Maintain async-first semantics across async paths.
- Keep public APIs tenant-aware by default.
- Keep line length within Ruff configuration.
- Imports must remain sorted and grouped.
- Tests should mirror the `cortex/` structure.
- New write paths must include validation, audit, and trust-boundary review.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not use `float` for finance or scoring-sensitive paths; use `Decimal`.
- Do not use `time.sleep()` in async code; use `asyncio.sleep()`.
- Do not use bare `print()` in core paths; use `logging` or Rich.
- Do not place business logic in `cli/*_cmds.py`.
- Do not modify `ledger.py` without understanding hash continuity and test coverage.
- Do not introduce schema changes without migration review.
- Do not store secrets in plaintext metadata.
- Do not bypass guards on write paths.
- Do not silently downgrade validation errors into permissive writes.
- Do not treat LLM output as trusted state.
- Do not document a capability as a named module unless that module exists or the implementation surface is explicitly identified.

## Change Protocol

Before changing critical trust surfaces:

1. Read affected tests first.
2. Read adjacent modules before modifying shared invariants.
3. For write-path changes, validate:
   - guard behavior
   - encryption/decryption flow
   - ledger continuity
   - audit trail emission
   - embedding/index side effects
   - tenant isolation
4. For schema changes:
   - **EXECUTE REQUIRED**: `alembic history --verbose`. Print exact downgrade target of the previous migration.
   - assess backward compatibility
   - document rollback constraints
   - check production irreversibility
5. For async changes:
   - verify absence of blocking calls
   - verify timeout behavior
   - verify cancellation behavior
   - verify connection/resource cleanup
6. For API changes:
   - verify route contract
   - verify CLI/API parity where relevant
   - verify typed response shape

## PR Acceptance Gate

A change is incomplete if it lacks any of:

- tests for modified behavior
- type coverage for public surfaces
- migration impact review for schema changes
- ledger/audit impact review for trust-surface changes
- async correctness review for concurrency-sensitive changes
- explicit documentation update if public behavior changed

## Write-Path Contract

All non-trivial writes should be understandable as:

```text
proposal → guards → schema/type validation → encryption → ledger/audit → persistence → index/update side effects
```

If a proposal fails validation, the write aborts.

## Epistemic Posture

CORTEX does not assume generative output is knowledge.
It assumes generative output is a probabilistic proposal that may be useful,
invalid, partial, or dangerous.

System state may only be mutated after that proposal crosses deterministic
validation boundaries: guards, typed interfaces, schemas, tests, cryptographic
logging, and external verification when required.
