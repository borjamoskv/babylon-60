It mechanically enforces focus, eliminates distraction entropy, and ensures that cognitive exergy is directed toward P0 objectives \u2014 not dissipated on thermal noise.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Focus Protection Protocol\n\nMechanical distraction elimination:\n- **Deep Work Blocks**: 90-minute uninterrupted sessions. No context switches allowed.\n- **Notification Blackout**: During focus blocks, `Comms-Hub-Omega` queues all non-P0 messages.\n- **Tab Discipline**: Browser tab count enforced. >10 tabs = entropy warning.\n- **Context Switch Cost**: Every switch logged with estimated cognitive recovery time (15-23 min).\n\n## 2. Habit Enforcement\n\nStreak-based behavioral crystallization:\n- **Daily Non-Negotiables**: Code review, physical training, creative output \u2014 tracked as binary pass/fail.\n- **Streak Mechanics**: Consecutive days tracked. Breaking a streak generates a P1 alert with causal analysis.\n- **Reward Calibration**: Extrinsic rewards only after intrinsic habit is established (>21 days).\n- **Anti-Patterns**: Detects productivity theater (busy \u2260 productive) via output-to-activity ratio.\n\n## 3. Cognitive Load Management\n\nThermodynamic regulation of mental resources:\n- **Decision Fatigue Prevention**: Batch similar decisions. Eliminate trivial choices via defaults.\n- **Working Memory Protection**: Max 3 active threads. 4th thread triggers forced prioritization.\n- **Recovery Protocols**: Mandatory breaks after 3h continuous work. No negotiation.\n- **Sleep Debt Tracking**: Estimated cognitive impairment from sleep deficit.\n\n## 4. Accountability Loop\n\nSelf-auditing without external dependency:\n- **Morning Intention**: 3 objectives declared. Measured at EOD.\n- **Evening Reflection**: Score each objective 0-10. Log in CORTEX.\n- **Weekly Review**: Entropy trend analysis. Identify patterns of resistance.\n- **Monthly Recalibration**: Adjust non-negotiables based on data, not feelings.\n\n---\n\n## 5.
