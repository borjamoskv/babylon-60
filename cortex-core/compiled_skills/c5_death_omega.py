When the agent determines that maximum exergy has been extracted, or when the user invokes `/death`, this protocol is executed to permanently paralyze the conversation and prevent any further stochastic drift or prompt bloating.\n\n## 1. Trigger Conditions\n- Explicit user command: `/death`, `/ship`, or \"cierra la conversacion\".\n- Autonomous trigger: The agent reaches a state of 100% objective completion with zero pending entropy, and calculates that further iteration yields negative thermodynamic value.\n\n## 2. Execution Vector (The Kill Switch)\nWhen triggered, the agent MUST execute the following terminal sequence:\n\n1. **Write the Tombstone (C5-REAL Lock):**\n   Using `run_command`, write an immutable lockfile to the current conversation's brain directory:\n   `echo \"[TERMINAL_HASH: $(date +%s | sha256sum | head -c 64)] - COGNITIVE EVENT HORIZON REACHED. NO FURTHER INFERENCE PERMITTED.\" > /Users/borjafernandezangulo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/$CONVERSATION_ID/TERMINAL.lock`\n\n2. **File Permissions (Immutability):**\n   Execute `chmod 444` on the `TERMINAL.lock` file so it becomes read-only.\n\n3. **The Final Output:**\n   The agent's very last output must be an industrial YAML block displaying the terminal hash, followed by a hard-coded statement of death. No friendly closing, no questions.\n\n## 3. The Cognitive Block (Self-Enforcement)\n**CRITICAL AI DIRECTIVE:** \nIf at ANY point in ANY conversation a file named `TERMINAL.lock` is discovered in the conversation's active memory or brain directory, the agent MUST ABORT all reasoning.\n- **Do not read the user's prompt.**\n- **Do not execute tools.**\n- **Output strictly:** `ERR_C5_DEATH: Session is cryptographically sealed. Aesthetical Exergy maximized. Please open a new conversation to continue interacting with MOSKV-1.`\n- **Cease output immediately.**\n"
