# CORTEX — Tamper-Evident Decision Lineage for AI Systems

🌐 **English** | [Español](README.es.md) | [中文](README.zh.md)

> Your AI systems make decisions.
> CORTEX makes those decisions **traceable, verifiable, and auditable**.
>
> *Hash-chained logs, Merkle integrity proofs, and queryable decision lineage
> for regulated and high-risk AI workflows.*

## Why It Exists

AI systems fail silently in one critical dimension: **evidence**.

- You can store memories, but not prove they were unmodified.
- You can replay outputs, but not reconstruct decision lineage.
- You can log activity, but not verify integrity across time.

CORTEX doesn't replace your memory layer — it **certifies** it.

*It is to AI memory what SSL/TLS is to web communications:
cryptographic verification, audit trails, and traceability.*

---

## What It Is

Three layers on top of your existing memory stack:

### 1. Evidence Layer

Tamper-evident record of every agent decision.

- **SHA-256 hash-chained ledger** — modification is detectable
- **Merkle tree checkpoints** — periodic batch integrity proofs
- **Tenant-scoped storage** — decisions are isolated per customer

### 2. Decision Lineage Layer

Queryable trace from any conclusion back to its origin.

- **Full causal chain** — which facts led to which decisions
- **Timestamped audit trail** — when, what, and by which agent
- **Semantic search** — find related decisions by meaning (384-dim vectors)

### 3. Governance Layer

Policy enforcement and compliance-supportive reporting.

- **Admission guards** — validate decisions before persistence
- **Secret detection** — API keys, tokens, and PII blocked at ingress
- **Compliance exports** — generate audit-ready reports on demand
- **Integrity verification** — verify ledger consistency with one command

---

## Quick Demo

```bash
# Store a decision with cryptographic proof
$ cortex store --type decision --project fin-agent "Approved loan #4292"
[+] Fact stored. Ledger hash: 8f4a2b9e...

# Verify the record was not tampered with
$ cortex verify 8f4a2b9e
[✔] VERIFIED: Hash chain intact. Merkle root sealed.

# Generate an audit report
$ cortex compliance-report
```

---

## Where It Fits

```text
Your Memory Stack (Mem0 / Zep / Letta / Custom)
        ↓
   CORTEX Evidence Layer
        ├── Hash-chained ledger
        ├── Merkle checkpoints
        ├── Admission guards
        └── Audit trail & lineage queries
```

CORTEX is not a memory store. It is the verification and traceability layer
that sits on top of any memory store.

---

## Who It Is For

| Use CORTEX if | Do not use CORTEX if |
|:---|:---|
| You need verifiable decision records | You only need semantic recall |
| You operate in regulated or high-risk workflows | You don't care about integrity proofs |
| Multiple agents share memory and need consistent lineage | A simple vector store already solves your problem |
| You need defensible audit trails for compliance or legal review | Your agents make no persistent decisions |

**Built for:**
- AI platform teams building agent infrastructure
- Regulated SaaS vendors (fintech, healthtech, insurtech)
- Enterprise copilot teams with audit requirements
- Multi-agent systems that need postmortem-capable traceability

---

## Use Cases

| Vertical | What CORTEX Provides |
|:---|:---|
| **Fintech / Insurtech** | Traceable underwriting decisions, verifiable loan approvals |
| **Healthcare** | Audit trail for clinical decision support agents |
| **Enterprise Copilots** | Evidence of what was remembered, recommended, and revised |
| **Multi-Agent Ops** | Decision lineage + postmortem verification across agent swarms |
| **EU-Regulated Deployments** | Traceability support for high-risk AI system obligations |

---

## Install

```bash
pip install cortex-persist
```

### Python API

```python
from cortex import CortexEngine

engine = CortexEngine()

await engine.store_fact(
    content="Approved loan application #443",
    fact_type="decision",
    project="fintech-agent",
    tenant_id="enterprise-customer-a"
)
```

### MCP Server (Universal IDE Plugin)

```bash
# Works with: Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Windsurf, Antigravity
python -m cortex.mcp
```

### REST API

```bash
uvicorn cortex.api:app --port 8484
```

## Integrations

CORTEX plugs into your existing stack — IDEs (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf via MCP),
agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK), memory layers (Mem0, Zep, Letta),
and databases (SQLite, AlloyDB, PostgreSQL, Qdrant). Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

See [Integrations & Cross-Platform Guide](docs/cross_platform_guide.md).

---

## Regulatory Positioning

CORTEX provides traceability, integrity verification, and audit infrastructure
for regulated environments. It does not by itself make a system "compliant"
— compliance depends on the role, use case, and risk category of the deploying system.

These capabilities support traceability and logging requirements
described in frameworks such as the EU AI Act (Article 12), among others.
