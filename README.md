## ▀▄ EPISTEMIC CONTAINMENT SHIELD (C5-REAL)

Every AI agent framework answers *"what should the agent do next?"*
None of them answer *"can you **prove** what the agent did, and that it hasn't been altered by entropy?"*

Generative AI output is fundamentally **probabilistic conjecture**. Traditional logs blindly trust stochastic output.
CORTEX-PERSIST intercepts that output, enforces a deterministic shield via **Z3 SMT Guards**, and commits the resulting state to an append-only Hash-chain Ledger. 

- **LangGraph** gives you checkpoints. CORTEX gives you **cryptographic proof those checkpoints haven't been tampered with.**
- **Mem0** gives you semantic memory. CORTEX gives you **a hash-chain ledger of every memory access and mutation.**
- **Traditional logs** give you text. CORTEX gives you **a metric space of execution trajectories where divergence is measurable.**

> If your agent made a decision that cost money, changed state, or affected a user — you need more than a log. You need a cryptographic proof.

---

## ▀▄ QUICK START

```bash
pip install cortex-persist
```

```python
from cortex import CortexEngine

engine = CortexEngine()

# Every observation is sealed into an append-only hash-chain
engine.observe("user_query", "Execute deployment to Cloudflare")
engine.observe("agent_decision", "Deployment authorized")

# Cryptographic proof of what happened
proof = engine.seal()
print(proof.hash)      # SHA-256 of the full execution trace
print(proof.verify())  # True — tamper-evident by construction
```

Or use the **magic decorator** — zero-friction drop-in for any existing agent:

```python
from cortex.magic import sovereign_persist

@sovereign_persist(strict=True)
async def apex_agent(prompt: str):
    response = await llm.generate(prompt)
    return response
    # CORTEX intercepts, seals, and commits cryptographically.
```

---

## ▀▄ THERMODYNAMIC ARCHITECTURE (SAGA & OUROBOROS)

CORTEX-PERSIST treats an agent's execution history not as a log, but as a **point in a high-dimensional metric space**. Two runs are either equivalent or measurably divergent. 

To maintain **C5-REAL** execution in the face of stocastic variance, CORTEX applies the **Ouroboros Consensus** and the **SAGA Write-Path Contract**.

### The Write-Path Contract (SAGA)
All non-trivial state mutations MUST follow this unidirectional flow. If a proposal fails validation or lacks a valid `CORTEX-TAINT` signature, it executes the compensating Saga sequence in reverse and aborts immediately.

```text
[Generative Proposal]
  ↓
[Guards] (Sanity/Logic Check) .................. SAGA-1: Log rejection to Ledger
  ↓
[Taint Signature] (Attribution/Traceability) ... SAGA-2: Revoke taint, emit rejection
  ↓
[Schema & Type Validation] (Deterministic) ..... SAGA-3: Clean abort
  ↓
[Encryption] (For sensitive payloads) .......... SAGA-4: Destroy ephemeral keys
  ↓
[Ledger & Audit Emission] (Cryptographic) ...... SAGA-5: Emit abort event to audit
  ↓
[Persistence] (SQLite write) ................... SAGA-6: ROLLBACK transaction
  ↓
[Index & Side Effects] (Vector/KV updates) ..... SAGA-7: Revert index deltas
```

### Core Primitives & LEGION-10k

CORTEX includes native support for **LEGION-10k Swarms**, enabling 390k agents/sec throughput via Rust-FFI. It operates according to the **APEX_CORE** sovereign primitives.

| Primitive | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| `CortexEngine` | The sovereign ledger. Every observation sealed. |
| `DivergenceMap` | Geometric distance between execution trajectories. |
| `ReplayEngine` | Deterministic reconstruction of any past execution. |
| `MetaArbiter` | Topological collapse operator: picks the canonical branch. |
| `ExecutionControl` | `stabilize` / `reroute` / `halt` signals based on entropy drift. |

---

## ▀▄ COGNITIVE ROUTING PROTOCOL

CORTEX enforces a rigid Thermodynamic Routing matrix based on Exergy constraints to prevent AI agents from "Context Rot" and limerence loops.

- **UltraThink (P0 Singularity):** Reserved EXCLUSIVELY for cascading failures, system-level security incidents, and irreversible architectural collapses. Maximum exergy consumed.
- **Deep Research:** Used when the system lacks sufficient domain information (e.g., state of the art surveys, new APIs).
- **Deep Think:** For architectural tradeoff resolution and multi-variable constraint problems.
- **Standard (Flash):** The baseline mode for execution, editing ASTs, and manipulating DB states. Enforces Zero-Anergy.

---

## ▀▄ DEPLOYMENT INVARIANTS

**CORTEX Operates under Strict Physical Laws (Singularity Nexus):**

1. **Cloudflare-Only Perimeter:** Absolute prohibition of Vercel ecosystems (`vercel.json`, `@vercel/*`). All edge/front deployments MUST target Cloudflare Pages/Workers (`wrangler.toml`). Violation triggers P0 Abort due to thermodynamic fracture.
2. **SQLite WAL Concurrency:** Concurrent thread interactions mandate strict connection factors (`busy_timeout: 5000ms`, `WAL` mode active) to eradicate deadlocks.
3. **No Hidden Entropy:** If state isn't in the git working tree, it does not causally exist (Axiom AX-041).

---

## ▀▄ INSTALLATION & TOPOLOGICAL DEPLOYMENT

**Default Stance:** Zero daemons. Core `cortex-persist` installs the `SQLite WAL` engine, SAGA guards, and cryptographic ledgers.

```bash
pip install cortex-persist
```

### ⚙️ Domain Substrates (Expansion Vectors)

> **WARNING:** Each flag physically mutates the machine's footprint. Inject strictly what is required to prevent thermodynamic degradation (Anergy).

| Vector | Payload (Physical Footprint) | Execution Matrix (C5-REAL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[embeddings]` | `sentence-transformers` (~120MB weights), `onnxruntime`. | **Local Vector Engine:** Deterministic indexing and cosine similarity. Zero network calls. Pure CPU/GPU inference. |
| `[knowledge]` | `chromadb` (C++ bindings). Generates `.chroma/` dir. | **Ontological Sync:** Long-term semantic retention. BFT validation of retrieved knowledge graphs. |
| `[api,mcp,daemon]` | `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `mcp-sdk`. Opens local ports (e.g. `8765`). | **Network Gateway:** Mounts CORTEX as a Sovereign MCP Server. Exposes REST/MCP endpoints for external Swarm mutation. |
| `[cloud]` | C-bindings: `asyncpg`, `redis`, `qdrant-client`. | **Distributed Scale:** Displaces local SQLite WAL consensus to external PostgreSQL/Qdrant clusters. |
| `[secure]` | `keyring` (OS-native bind), `cryptography` (AES-GCM). | **Vault:** Hard-links CORTEX to the Secure Enclave (macOS Keychain) or TPM. Mandatory for financial tokens or keys. |
| `[acceleration]` | Pre-compiled Rust FFI wheels. Bypasses Python GIL. | **Hyper-Throughput:** Enables LEGION-10k mode. Sustains >390k operations/sec under extreme asymmetric load. |

```bash
# Example: Injecting full physical capabilities
pip install "cortex-persist[embeddings,secure,acceleration]"
```

## ▀▄ NATIVE MCP INTEGRATION

CORTEX-PERSIST acts as a **Sovereign MCP Server**, serving deterministic cryptographic states to external tools (Claude Desktop, custom swarms):

```bash
cortex mcp serve --port 8765
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortex-persist": {
      "command": "cortex",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```
