CORTEX Persist gives teams shipping AI into high-stakes workflows verifiable memory,
tamper-evident decision lineage, and exportable evidence. It adds hash-chained records and
verification commands so teams can inspect what happened instead of reconstructing it later.

## Why Teams Star This

- You can prove what happened, not just log it.
- You can verify ledger continuity with one command.
- You can export reviewable evidence without custom tooling.

If this aligns with your roadmap, [star the repo](https://github.com/borjamoskv/Cortex-Persist/stargazers) to follow releases.

## Quick Command Flow

1. `cortex init`
2. `cortex store ... --type knowledge`
3. `cortex trust-ledger verify`

## What It Is

CORTEX Persist is designed for workflows where a plain log is not enough.

- Store structured facts and decisions.
- Hash-chain every write into a tamper-evident ledger.
- Search and recall persisted knowledge.
- Verify the ledger when you need evidence, not guesses.
- Export artifacts for reviews, audits, and incident response.

It sits alongside your existing stack. Use it with your current database, observability tools,
and vector search where that makes sense.

## Best Fit

- High-stakes AI workflows that can take irreversible actions.
- Support, approval, pricing, finance, and compliance flows.
- Long-running systems that need traceable state transitions.
- Teams that need a defensible record after the fact.

## Not A Replacement For

- Observability platforms such as Datadog or ELK.
- Dedicated vector databases for broad ephemeral retrieval.
- Human review, legal review, or compliance judgment.

## Install

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install cortex-persist
```

Add extras only when you need them:

```bash
pip install "cortex-persist[api]"   # REST API
pip install "cortex-persist[mcp]"   # MCP server
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/borjamoskv/Cortex-Persist.git
cd Cortex-Persist
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart In 3 Steps

```bash
# 1) Install
pip install cortex-persist

# 2) Persist a first fact
cortex init
cortex store my-project "FastAPI supports async request handlers" --type knowledge

# 3) Verify trust chain
cortex trust-ledger verify
```

Need the full path (search, recall, compliance snapshot, API/MCP extras)?
Use the guided [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md).

## Python Integration

```python
import asyncio
from cortex import CortexEngine


async def main() -> None:
    engine = CortexEngine()
    try:
        fact_id = await engine.store(
            project="demo-agent",
            content="FastAPI supports async request handlers",
            fact_type="knowledge",
        )

        results = await engine.search("async request handlers", top_k=3, project="demo-agent")
        ledger = await engine.verify_ledger()

        assert fact_id
        assert results
        assert ledger.get("valid") is True
    finally:
        await engine.close()


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Advanced In-Repo Surfaces

The repository also contains broader operator surfaces: swarm orchestration, additional CLI groups,
advanced HTTP routes, dashboards, and script catalogs. Those pieces are available in-repo, but
they are not the recommended first integration target.

The default FastAPI app and MCP server stay on the narrower product surface first. Broader HTTP
routes and MCP tool families are opt-in via flags such as `CORTEX_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_API=1` and
`CORTEX_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP=1`.

Use [docs/product-surface.md](docs/product-surface.md) as the canonical boundary between the
verifiable-memory product surface and the broader repository tooling.

## Public Roadmap

You can track upcoming milestones publicly in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

- `v0.4.0` (Next): GraphQL API planning, distributed event bus, Redis L1 cache, and TS SDK hardening.
- `v1.0.0` (Vision): managed dashboard, federation, dual compliance mode, and stronger encryption posture.

Roadmap feedback is welcome via issues and discussions.
