Governance Test: API Surface Canonical Invariants

Enforces ADR-0003. This test guarantees that `cortex.api.core` remains the
declared canonical API surface and that the legacy `api.server` module
retains its deprecation banner. If any of these invariants break, the
architectural governance has been violated.
