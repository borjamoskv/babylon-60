# Version Support

This document defines the support posture for public CORTEX Persist release lines.

## Current Policy

| Release line | Status | Support posture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `0.3.x` beta | Active | Best-effort fixes, security triage, and documentation maintenance |
| `< 0.3.0` | Unsupported | Upgrade required before support review |

## Interpretation

- **Active** means the release line is still considered current for issue triage and security review.
- **Unsupported** means fixes are not backported and support requests may be redirected to upgrade first.
- **Beta** means the project may still change quickly, even if the technical surface is already substantial.

## Lifecycle Notes

- The current policy is line-based, not date-based.
- Support for the active beta line ends when a newer public line supersedes it or the policy is revised explicitly in-repo.
- Unsupported lines do not receive routine backports.

## Backport Policy

- By default, fixes land forward on the active line.
- Security or stability fixes are not promised as backports unless explicitly stated for a release line.
- Buyers who need dated maintenance commitments or LTS behavior should treat that as a separate commercial discussion rather than an implied repository policy.

## Compatibility Baseline

- **Python:** `>=3.10`
- **Primary package:** `cortex-persist`
- **Preferred source of truth for current metadata:** [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)

## Enterprise Guidance

If you are evaluating CORTEX for production or acquisition:

- pin exact versions during evaluation
- review [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](RELEASE_PROCESS.md) for package publication flow
- align support expectations through [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md)
- treat roadmap items as non-contractual unless separately agreed
