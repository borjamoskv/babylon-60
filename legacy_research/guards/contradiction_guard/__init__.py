# [C5-REAL] Exergy-Maximized
"""
CORTEX - Contradiction Guard (Axiom 20: Epistemic Consistency).

Every new decision must explicitly invalidate its predecessors or confirm
compatibility. This guard runs at store-time and returns potential
conflicts so the agent can disambiguate before persisting.

Strategy (4-layer, O(N) bounded):
  1. FTS5 keyword overlap - fast, coarse.
  2. Project+topic co-occurrence - medium precision.
  3. Negation / supersession detection - high precision.
  4. Embedding cosine similarity - semantic precision (graceful degradation).

Returns a ConflictReport with scored candidates.
